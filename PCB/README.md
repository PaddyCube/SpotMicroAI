 My Version of SpotMicroAI
 
 Attention: all PCB files and schematics provided here are never tested and will have lots of bugs.
 Don't use them to produce any PCB. They came without any warranty and will not work at all.
 
 Why are the files here?
 I've tested some PCB designs and didn't want to throw everything to paperbin. 
 My initial idea was to have some protection and consumption monitor for each servo.
 
 As all PCBs are too large and too expensive to produce, I never produced a single one.
